# trade-spend-leakage — Current Work Plan

The current arc of work. Updated when the arc changes, not every
session. For session-by-session state, see HANDOFF.md.

---

## Goal

Complete Phase 1 (scoping and planning) so the project is ready to build.

## Why this arc, why now

Project just initialized. No stack, no spec, no plan. Phase 1 gates the build — nothing gets built until /clarify, /office-hours, /plan-ceo-review, and /plan-eng-review are done.

## Business question this arc answers

What exactly are we building, for whom, and how — so the build phase has no ambiguity about scope or deliverables.

## Goal — 2026-05-31 (confirmed via /clarify)

A portfolio piece demonstrating trade spend domain expertise to CFO/CEO buyers. Two linked deliverables:

1. **Interactive dashboard** — hosted at a public URL (Fly.io or Vercel), fully self-serve, covering all 5 analytical moves: net revenue ranking, trade spend efficiency, leakage detection (4 sub-types), promotional ROI, accrual reconciliation. Backed by read-only Cinderhaven Postgres on Fly.io.
2. **Excel workbook** — downloadable from the dashboard. CFO can click a finding on screen, then trace it to specific rows in the workbook. Credibility artifact ("this is the depth of what you'd get"), not a self-serve tool.

**What done looks like:** Live URL a client opens independently, all 5 moves functional, Excel downloadable and traceable to dashboard numbers.

**Out of scope:** Modifying Cinderhaven SSOT, self-serve client data input, ongoing TPM tooling.

**Constraints:** Read-only Postgres on Fly.io. No Streamlit. No Netlify. Stack decided during /ce:brainstorm to serve the deliverable.

## Tasks

- [x] Run /clarify to reach 95% confidence on scope and requirements
- [x] Run /office-hours to stress-test the idea and approach
- [x] Run /plan-ceo-review for the product gate
- [x] Run /plan-eng-review for the architecture gate
- [x] Determine and record the stack (Dash + Fly.io + SQLite snapshot)
- [x] Define the Cinderhaven synthetic data schema (verified via trade-spend-data-diagnostic codebase)
- [x] Update PLAN.md with Phase 2 (build) arc

## Out of scope for this arc

- Any actual code
- Data generation / synthetic dataset creation
- Visualization implementation
- Excel workbook generation

## Definition of done for this arc

- [x] /clarify complete — business question, deliverables, success criteria all written down
- [x] Stack chosen and recorded in DECISIONS.md
- [x] Cinderhaven synthetic data schema defined
- [x] All four Heavy-tier gate commands run
- [x] Phase 2 arc defined in PLAN.md

---

## Phase 2 — Build (current arc)

See `docs/plans/2026-05-31-001-feat-trade-spend-leakage-dashboard-plan.md` for full implementation plan.

### Goal

Ship the Dash dashboard and linked Excel workbook across 8 implementation units, built in sales-impact order.

### Tasks

- [x] U1 — Project setup: `cinderhaven-data` submodule, `pipeline/db.py`, `app/app.py` skeleton
- [x] U1.5 — Switch `pipeline/db.py` `source_conn()` from SQLite to Postgres (`DATABASE_URL` via psycopg2) — required before any move pipeline logic is written
- [x] U2 — Move 1: Net Revenue Ranking bump chart + app shell (first shippable milestone)
- [x] U3 — Move 3: Leakage Detection ledger + AG Grid expand (second shippable milestone)
- [x] U4 — Move 2: Trade Spend Efficiency dual-measure chart
- [x] U5 — Move 4: Promotional ROI scatter chart + rolling-median baseline
- [x] U6 — Move 5: Accrual Reconciliation bar chart
- [x] U7 — Excel workbook generation + download button
- [x] U8 — Fly.io deployment

### Definition of done for Phase 2

- [x] Dashboard accessible at a public Fly.io URL without login — https://trade-spend.lailarallc.com/
- [x] All 5 analytical moves functional
- [x] "Download workbook" produces a valid xlsx with 6 sheets
- [x] Workbook numbers match dashboard numbers

## Improvement history

<!-- Entries are added by /improve — don't delete this section -->

### 2026-05-31 — Improvement pass
- **Trigger:** User-initiated, post-ship pre-client cleanup
- **What was reviewed:** README, app/app.py, app/db.py, project root, src/ directory, error handling
- **What was fixed:**
  - README: added live URL, "Deployed state" context, and data refresh pattern (fly proxy → pipeline → fly deploy)
  - `app/db.py`: removed stale "75 rows" docstring from `get_promo_roi()`; narrowed all bare `except Exception:` to `except sqlite3.OperationalError:` for consistent, non-swallowing error handling; added same guard to `get_net_revenue()`
  - `app/app.py`: removed dead try/except ImportError fallback that could never trigger
  - Moved `portfolio_project_brief_trade_spend_leakage.md` from root to `docs/`
  - Removed empty `src/CLAUDE.md` (src/ had no source code — conventions doc was misleading)
- **Deferred:** None
- **Next review:** 2026-07-01 (stable project, ~30-day cadence)

### 2026-06-01 — Improvement pass
- **Trigger:** User-initiated, second pass after v1.0-client-ready tag. Included security + data-analysis deep reviews.
- **What was reviewed:** Security audit (all Python + Dockerfile), code review (diff clean), data analysis correctness review (all 5 pipeline moves + charts + footnotes)
- **What was fixed:**
  - **Critical** — `pipeline/move3_leakage.py`: added `_SLUG_MAP_CTE` to `_DOUBLE_DIP_SQL`, `_GHOST_PROMO_SQL`, `_RATE_DISCREPANCY_SQL`. The `RET-*` vs lowercase-slug `retailer_id` mismatch was causing double-dip and rate-discrepancy queries to return 0 rows, and ghost-promo to flag all billbacks. Leakage numbers were materially wrong. Reran pipeline → redeployed. New numbers: 1,521 instances / $144,320 (was 2,512 / $235,760 due to inflation).
  - **Important** — `app/layout.py`: Move 5 accrual footnote updated to explicitly state "actual" includes all deduction types (operational + trade), not a pure trade-spend comparison.
  - **Important** — `app/app.py`: `debug=True` gated on `DASH_DEBUG` env var (defaults `False`).
  - **Nice to have** — `incremental_margin` duplicate column removed from pipeline, db reader, workbook tab, and tests. Column was identical to `incremental_revenue` but implied net-of-cost margin.
  - **Nice to have** — `pipeline/move2_efficiency.py`: `warnings.warn` added for unmapped `promotions.retailer_id` slugs.
- **Deferred:** Move 5 `actual` could be further filtered to trade-only deduction types for a cleaner comparison — deferred; footnote clarification is sufficient for the portfolio piece.
- **Next review:** 2026-07-01

### 2026-09-23 — Audit (health check only)
- **Findings:** 0 critical, 7 important, 5 nice-to-have
- **Top concerns:** The gitleaks pre-commit hook never runs because core.hooksPath points at scripts/git-hooks (pre-push only), so secret scanning is silently off. Move 5 accrual compares rate-card accrual (~$3.2M) to all deductions (~$0.4M), so the +$2.6M variance is a definitional artifact, and Move 2/Move 3 matching rules (promo cost summed across duplicate promo rows; billbacks matched to off-invoice promos by retailer only, no SKU) may inflate figures. PLAN.md/CLAUDE.md are stale (Phase 1 goal, pending SQLite-to-Postgres note) and the local checkout sits on a merged feature branch behind origin.
- **Action taken:** Audit only — no fixes this session
- **Next review:** 2026-10-21
